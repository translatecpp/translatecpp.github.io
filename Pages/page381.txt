Section 72.9: Function Try Blocks In destructor
struct A
{
      ~A() noexcept(false) try
      {
          // destructor body
      }
      catch (...)
      {
          // exceptions of destructor body are caught here
          // if no exception is thrown here
          // then the caught exception is re-thrown.
      }
};
Note that, although this is possible, one needs to be very careful with throwing from destructor, as if a destructor
called during stack unwinding throws an exception, std — terminate is called.
