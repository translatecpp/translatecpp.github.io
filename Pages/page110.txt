The type void* ("pointer to void") has the property that any object pointer can be converted to it and back and
result in the same pointer. This feature makes the type void* suitable for certain kinds of (type-unsafe) type-erasing
interfaces, for example for generic contexts in C-style APIs (e.g. qsort, pthread_create).
Any expression may be converted to an expression of type void; this is called a discarded-value expression:
static_cast<void>(std::printf("Hello, %s!\n", name)); // discard return value
This may be useful to signal explicitly that the value of an expression is not of interest and that the expression is to
be evaluated for its side effects only.
Section 22.6: wchar_t
An integer type large enough to represent all characters of the largest supported extended character set, also
known as the wide-character set. (It is not portable to make the assumption that wchar_t uses any particular
encoding, such as UTF-16.)
It is normally used when you need to store characters over ASCII 255 , as it has a greater size than the character
type char.
const wchar_t message_ahmaric[] = L"       \\n"; //Ahmaric for "hello, world\\n"
const wchar_t message_chinese[] = L"□□ nn\\n";// Chinese for "hello, world\\n"
const wchar_t message_hebrew[] = L"dViv DiVwWn"; //Hebrew for "hello, world\\n"
const wchar_t message_russian[] = L"npMBeT MMp\\n"; //Russian for "hello, world\\n"
const wchar_t message_tamil[] = L"nnnoon □ □□□□\\n"; //Tamil for "hello, world\\n"
Section 22.7: float
A floating point type. Has the narrowest range out of the three floating point types in C++.
float area(float radius) {
     const float pi = 3.14159f;
     return pi*radius*radius;
}
Section 22.8: double
A floating point type. Its range includes that of float. When combined with long, denotes the long double floating
point type, whose range includes that of double.
double area(double radius) {
     const double pi = 3.141592653589793;
     return pi*radius*radius;
}
Section 22.9: long
Denotes a signed integer type that is at least as long as int, and whose range includes at least -2147483647 to
+2147483647, inclusive (that is, -(2A31 - 1) to +(2A31 - 1)). This type can also be written as long int.
const long approx_seconds_per_year = 60L*60L*24L*365L;
The combination long double denotes a floating point type, which has the widest range out of the three floating
point types.
