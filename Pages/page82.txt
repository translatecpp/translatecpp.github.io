      //will execute if a is a string "test"
 } else {
      // only if the first failed, will execute
 }
for multiple choices :
 if (a=='a') {
 // if a is a char valued 'a'
 } else if (a=='b') {
 // if a is a char valued 'b'
 } else if (a=='c') {
 // if a is a char valued 'c'
 } else {
 //if a is none of the above
 }
however it must be noted that you should use 'switch' instead if your code checks for the same variable's value
Section 16.10: goto
Jumps to a labelled statement, which must be located in the current function.
 bool f(int arg) {
      bool result = false;
      hWidget widget = get_widget(arg);
      if (!g()) {
          // we can't continue, but must do cleanup still
          goto end;
      }
      // ...
      result = true;
   end:
      release_widget(widget);
      return result;
 }
Section 16.11: Jump statements : break, continue, goto, exit
The break instruction:
Using break we can leave a loop even if the condition for its end is not fulfilled. It can be used to end an infinite
loop, or to force it to end before its natural end
The syntax is
 break;
Example: we often use break in switch cases,ie once a case i switch is satisfied then the code block of that
condition is executed .
 switch(conditon){
 case 1 : block1;
 case 2: block2;
 case 3: block3;
 default: blockdefault;
 }
