Printing N space-delimited random numbers:
const int N = 10;
std::generate_n(std::ostream_iterator<int>(std::cout, " "), N, std::rand);
Arrays
As in the section about reading text files, almost all these considerations may be applied to native arrays. For
example, let's print squared values from a native array:
int v[] = {1,2,3,4,8,16};
std::transform(v, std::end(v), std::ostream_iterator<int>(std::cout, " "),
[](int val) {
     return val * val;
});
