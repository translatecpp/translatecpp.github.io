values correspond to the year of finalization for each version of the ISO C++ standard. As of GCC 6.1.0, valid values
for the std= flag are c++98/c++03, c++11, c++14, and c++17/c++1z. Values separated by a forward slash are
equivalent.
g++ -std=c++11 <file>
GCC includes some compiler-specific extensions that are disabled when they conflict with a standard specified by
the -std= flag. To compile with all extensions enabled, the value gnu++XX may be used, where XX is any of the years
used by the c++ values listed above.
The default standard will be used if none is specified. For versions of GCC prior to 6.1.0, the default is -
std=gnu++03; in GCC 6.1.0 and greater, the default is -std=gnu++14.
Note that due to bugs in GCC, the -pthread flag must be present at compilation and linking for GCC to support the
C++ standard threading functionality introduced with C++11, such as std ::thread and std ::wait_for. Omitting it
when using threading functions may result in no warnings but invalid results on some platforms.
Linking with libraries:
Use the -l option to pass the library name:
g++ main.cpp -lpcre2-8
#pcre2-8 is the PCRE2 library for 8bit code units (UTF-8)
If the library is not in the standard library path, add the path with -L option:
g++ main.cpp -L/my/custom/path/ -lmylib
Multiple libraries can be linked together:
g++ main.cpp -lmylib1 -lmylib2 -lmylib3
If one library depends on another, put the dependent library before the independent library:
g++ main.cpp -lchild-lib -lbase-lib
Or let the linker determine the ordering itself via --start-group and --end-group (note: this has significant
performance cost):
g++ main.cpp -Wl,--start-group -lbase-lib -lchild-lib -Wl,--end-group
