          return *this;
     int data;
};
int main()
{
    Foo foo(2); //Foo(int data) / Normal Constructor called
    Foo foo2 = foo; //Copy Constructor Called
    cout << foo2.data << endl;
    Foo foo3(42);
    foo3=foo; //Assignment Constructor Called
    cout << foo3.data << endl;
}
Output:
2
2
Here you can see we first call the copy constructor by executing the line Foo foo2 = foo; . Since we didn't initialize
it previously. And then next we call the assignment operator on foo3 since it was already initialized foo3=foo;
