       irreflexivity invariant) equivalent to itself.
In terms of C++ this means if you have two objects of a given type, you should return the following values when
compared with the operator <.
X    a;
X    b;
Condition:            Test: Result 
a is equivalent to b: a < b false  
a is equivalent to b  b < a false  
a is less than b      a < b true   
a is less than b      b < a false  
b is less than a      a < b false  
b is less than a      b < a true   
How you define equivalent/less is totally dependent on the type of your object.
