Section 1.1: Hello World
This program prints Hello World! to the standard output stream:
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
     std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
}

Analysis
Let's examine each part of this code in detail:
    •  #include <iostream> is a preprocessor directive that includes the content of the standard C++ header file
      iostream.
      iostream is a standard library header file that contains definitions of the standard input and output
      streams. These definitions are included in the std namespace, explained below.
      The standard input/output (I/O) streams provide ways for programs to get input from and output to an
      external system -- usually the terminal.
    •  int main() { ... } defines a new function named main. By convention, the main function is called upon
      execution of the program. There must be only one main function in a C++ program, and it must always return
      a number of the int type.
      Here, the int is what is called the function's return type. The value returned by the main function is an exit
      code.
      By convention, a program exit code of 0 or EXIT_SUCCESS is interpreted as success by a system that executes
      the program. Any other return code is associated with an error.
      If no return statement is present, the main function (and thus, the program itself) returns 0 by default. In this
      example, we don't need to explicitly write return 0;.
      All other functions, except those that return the void type, must explicitly return a value according to their
      return type, or else must not return at all.
