#define something something_else
directive. This tells the preprocessor that as it goes along the file, it should replace every occurrence of something
with something_else. It can also make things similar to functions, but that probably counts as advanced C++.
The something_else is not needed, but if you define something as nothing, then outside preprocessor directives, all
occurrences of something will vanish.
This actually is useful, because of the #if,#else and #ifdef directives. The format for these would be the following:
#if something==true
//code
#else
//more code
#endif
#ifdef thing_that_you_want_to_know_if_is_defined
//code
#endif
These directives insert the code that is in the true bit, and deletes the false bits. this can be used to have bits of
code that are only included on certain operating systems, without having to rewrite the whole code.
