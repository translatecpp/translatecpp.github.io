If, for example, the preferred locale is German and hence uses a different number format, the example writes
78 123,456
78.123.456
78123.456
(note the decimal comma in the first line).
Section 13.7: Checking end of file inside a loop condition, bad
practice?
eof returns true only after reading the end of file. It does NOT indicate that the next read will be the end of
stream.
while (!f.eof())
{
   // Everything is OK
   f >> buffer;
   // What if *only* now the eof / fail bit is set?
   /* Use 'buffer' */
}
You could correctly write:
while (!f.eof())
{
   f >> buffer >> std::ws;
   if (f.fail())
     break;
   /* Use 'buffer' */
}
but
while (f >> buffer)
{
   /* Use 'buffer' */
}
is simpler and less error prone.
