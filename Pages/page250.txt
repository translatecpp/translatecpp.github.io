                                               struct Derived2 : Base {
                                               using Base::Base;
};
int main() {
     Derivedl d1(42, "Hello, world");
     Derived2 d2(42, "Hello, world");
}
In the above code, both Derived1 and Derived2 have constructors that forward the arguments directly to the
corresponding constructor of Base. Derived1 performs the forwarding explicitly, while Derived2, using the C++11
feature of inheriting constructors, does so implicitly.
