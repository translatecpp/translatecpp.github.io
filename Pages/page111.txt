When the long specifier occurs twice, as in long long, it denotes a signed integer type that is at least as long as
long, and whose range includes at least -9223372036854775807 to +9223372036854775807, inclusive (that is, -
(2A63 - 1) to +(2A63 - 1)).
// support files up to 2 TiB
const long long max_file_size = 2LL << 40;
Section 22.10: short
Denotes a signed integer type that is at least as long as char, and whose range includes at least -32767 to +32767,
inclusive. This type can also be written as short int.
// (during the last year)
short hours_worked(short days_worked) {
return 8*days_worked;
}
Section 22.11: bool
An integer type whose value can be either true or false.
bool is_even(int x) {
     return x%2 == 0;
}
const bool b = is_even(47); // false
