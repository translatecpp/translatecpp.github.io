Note: In the example std ::async is launched with policy std ::launch_deferred. This is to avoid a new thread
being created in every call. In the case of our example, the calls to std ::async are made out of order, the they
synchronize at the calls for std ::future ::get().
std:: launch_async forces a new thread to be created in every call.
The default policy is std ::launch ::deferred | std ::launch ::async, meaning the implementation determines the
policy for creating new threads.
