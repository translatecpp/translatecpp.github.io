to build (as well as install) most packages (in the simple case):
 ./configure && make && make install
As such, Autotools also has a relationship with certain package managers, especially those that are attached to
operating systems that conform to the POSIX Standard(s).
Section 130.5: Ninja
Introduction
The Ninja build system is described by its project website as "a small build system with a focus on speed." Ninja is
designed to have its files generated by build system file generators, and takes a low-level approach to build
systems, in contrast to higher-level build system managers like CMake or Meson.
Ninja is primarily written in C++ and Python, and was created as an alternative to the SCons build system for the
Chromium project.
Section 130.6: NMAKE (Microsoft Program Maintenance Utility)
Introduction
NMAKE is a command-line utility developed by Microsoft to be used primarily in conjunction with Microsoft Visual
Studio and/or the Visual C++ command line tools.
NMAKE is build system that falls under the Make family of build systems, but has certain distinct features that
diverge from Unix-like Make programs, such as supporting Windows-specific file path syntax (which itself differs
from Unix-style file paths).
