Empty base optimization is commonly used by allocator-aware standard library classes (std ::vector,
std ::function, std ::shared_ptr, etc) to avoid occupying any additional storage for its allocator member if the
allocator is stateless. This is achieved by storing one of the required data members (e.g., begin, end, or capacity
pointer for the vector).
