The goto instruction:
It allows making an absolute jump to another point in the program. You should use this feature carefully since its
execution ignores any type of nesting limitation. The destination point is identified by a label, which is then used as
an argument for the goto instruction. A label is made of a valid identifier followed by a colon (:)
The syntax is
goto label;
label: statement;
Note: Use of goto statement is highly discouraged because it makes difficult to trace the control flow of a program,
making the program hard to understand and hard to modify.
