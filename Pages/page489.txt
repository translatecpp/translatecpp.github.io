      //The anonymous struct's members are accessed as if members of the parent struct
      Example() : inner_b(2), outer_b(4) {
      inner_b = outer_b + 2;
      }
};
Example ex;
//The same holds true for external code referencing the struct
ex.inner_b -= ex.outer_b;
Section 92.4: Anonymous Union
Member names of an anonymous union belong to the scope of the union declaration an must be distinct to all
other names of this scope. The example here has the same construction as example Anonymous Members using
"struct" but is standard conform.
struct Sample {
union {
int a;
int b;
     };
     int c;
};
int main()
{
   Sample sa;
   sa.a =3;
   sa.b =4;
   sa.c =5;
}
